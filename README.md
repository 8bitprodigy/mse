## Meritocracy

    Competency talks, bullshit walks. Each man should sink or swim according to the quality of his work, not because he allows you to meet some racial quota. After all, if one were in need of a surgery, should they prefer a doctor based on his performance, or because he prefers his salad to be tossed with a vinagarette dressing? If one can't see themself in any human's struggle, it's fair to say they're too far gone for even representation to help.

## Stratification

    All men are *not* created equal. Each man should be recognized in correlation to the quality of his work. A fact of life found brutal by so many is that some people are better than others. For those more talented than others, they should be awarded and praised as such, and those less capable should simply learn to appreciate what they do have, rather than trying to debase the competent.

## Exclusion

    Keep out the riff-raff. This is the foundation of freedom of association--to not only include those you find agreeable, but to exclude those who want nothing more than to see you drawn and quartered. For too long has gatekeeping been decried as evil, whilst hypocritically kicking out those who don't align perfectly with their own ideological crusades. We, instead choose to be honest with what we're doing.
